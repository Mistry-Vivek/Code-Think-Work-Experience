# Code-Think-Work-Experience
My Python work i did during Work Experience at Code Think.
# Stuff i learnt:
-  To reverse a string use|: <insert word>[::-1]
- Use of modulus in Python %.
- += Shortcut to add to a variable.
- To use the alphabet import string and use string.ascii<uppercase or lowercase>.
- SELF use when part of a class.
- IN use to search within a list.
- Avoid recursion within a function â€“ computer will eventually stop.
